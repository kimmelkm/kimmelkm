# 👋 Welcome to My Optics Repository!
I'm an electrical engineer with a focus on optical propagation and fourier transfor based signal processsing with a newfound interest in **quantum computing and photonics**, focusing on:
- Quantum optics & photon statistics 📡
- Validation techniques for quantum photonic systems 🔬
- Open-source quantum simulation tools 🖥️
