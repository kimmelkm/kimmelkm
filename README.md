# 👋 Welcome to my Repository!
I'm an electrical engineer with a focus on Fourier-transform-based signal processsing and optical propagation with a newfound interest in **quantum computing and photonics**, focusing on:
- Quantum optics & photon statistics 📡
- Validation techniques for quantum photonic systems 🔬
- Open-source quantum simulation tools 🖥️
